# AI Prompt Portfolio

## Description
This repository contains professional-level AI prompts crafted for platforms like ChatGPT, MidJourney, and other large language models. The goal is to help refine prompts and test them for better output generation.

## Purpose
As a prompt engineer, I design prompts that generate more accurate and creative responses from AI models. The goal of this repository is to share prompts that work effectively and to contribute to the AI community.

## Technologies Used
- **ChatGPT**: For creating text-based prompts.
- **MidJourney**: For image generation prompts.
- **DALLÂ·E**: For creative visual prompt generation.

## How to Use
To use the prompts in this repository:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Choose a prompt from the examples folder.
3. Run it in the corresponding AI platform (e.g., ChatGPT, MidJourney).

## Prompt Examples
### Example 1:
**Prompt**: "Generate 3 creative taglines for a mobile battle game."  
**Output**:  
1. "Fight for Love"  
2. "Clash of Korum"  
3. "Rise of Moegyoe"  
**Feedback**: Works well, but the third tagline needs more originality.

### Example 2:
**Prompt**: "Create a futuristic logo design for a tech startup."  
**Output**:  
1. Minimalistic, geometric shape with a metallic finish.  
2. A sleek, modern font with a neon blue glow.  
**Feedback**: Great for tech designs, though could use more color variety.
